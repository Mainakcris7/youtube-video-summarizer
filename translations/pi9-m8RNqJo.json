Alright, there was the World Cup draw, but it wasn't supposed to happen like this. Agreed, this is the last World Cup for Ronaldo and Messi, but quarter-finals mean that do you want Ronaldo to eliminate Messi or Messi to eliminate Ronaldo here. Can you watch it? Can you not watch it? Just tell me right now in the comments section whether you can watch this match"

I think here you might be interested in watching South Africa versus Mexico, but first, brother, we will talk about Ronaldo-Messi Portugal-Argentina later. Of course, that's the highlight, I think, and this is not a game. [Laughter] It's not fixed. Both of these can slip. And what do I see towards Argentina? I should look into my own collar. I should talk about my own boys. I should talk about my lads. These guys have already slipped. If they reach there, I will clap twice anyway. But still, first, brother, let's talk about the World Cup 2026 draw here, and if I remove the part of the World Cup draw here, then besides that, I think"

This mishmash of all their American versions has been forcibly crammed down our throats here. But let's come to the draw, and here we saw the fate of 48 teams being locked. The fate of 42 teams and the remaining six teams is in March, and they also know that if they qualify for the World Cup, which group they belong to. I think I should say this in the beginning. If you were thinking that a Group of Death would form here, well, according to me, some interesting groups have formed. But if you assume a short shot Group of Death that involves Germany being ousted by South Korea or Spain being knocked out or Brazil being eliminated from the group stage, I think the chances of that have decreased already the way it goes when you expand from 32 to 48 teams, groups get more diluted."

Also, the third and fourth-ranked teams cannot clash until the semifinals. Furthermore, there will only be one team from each confederation in a group, and if there is a UEFA team, there can be two. So, many permutations and combinations have been avoided here, and in trying to avoid all this, Argentina and Portugal are serving this to themselves. But first, let's take a look at the groups here. Look, I'm not saying anything is rigged or anything, but it's a coincidence. It's a coincidence that Mexico, Canada, and the United States of America got good groups, brother. Speaking of Group A, Mexico, South Africa, Korea Republic, and Winner Playoff D. I feel that here, not just Mexico, the way they play and on their home ground, they'll have quite good games here, and you already know here"

I think if I talk about initial favorites here, there's still a lot of time; managers can change, teams can change, but for me, Mexico and Korea Republic seem to be advancing from here. Along with this, talking about Group B, Canada, Winner Playoff A - meaning, Italy and the like could enter Winner Playoff A. It includes Qatar and Switzerland; I think Canada, being the host. Right? I think they'll make it through here. But for now, it seems to me that Italy might make it out of here. Again, many of you might be thinking about Switzerland, what about Switzerland? Look, brother, good teams will easily make it to the knockouts. How will they make it? Then in the knockouts, the boots and slaps they will face is another matter. But I feel that in the group stages, in what we have before us,"

Apart from the storylines, which are already here, the storylines themselves are gold and diamonds, but besides that, if we talk about stakes and whatnot, whether any team will get knocked out from the group stage, no, it's not about which big team will be seen exiting in the group stage, it might happen; you know, the World Cup is a different sport. Even from the football world cup, it's different, brother, the World Cup is different. You might feel that Cape Verde could talk about knocking out Spain here, it could happen, it won't, but if it can happen somewhere, it can happen in the World Cup. Here, the top two teams have 12 groups. That means the top two teams will directly qualify for the round of 32. But since there will only be 24 teams, there will be eight more teams, which will be the third team of the group, and the top eight from among them will also go through. That means there are 12 groups. In the 12 groups, the third-place teams, among them, the top eight will advance."

Speaking of Group C, just as Brazil saw Morocco, Brazil was quite shocked. Carlo Ancelotti had submitted his resignation. Carlo is saying that if there was a Group of Death, it would have been this group, not kidding. But I think Brazil might not be mourning too much here. Of course, it's Morocco. So the first game is Brazil versus Morocco, and it will set the tone for the group. But apart from that, if anyone has mourned the most here, it would be Scotland. And what to say about Hai, they haven't even allowed fans, the USA isn\u2019t even giving visas here, and Iran was not even invited to the World Cup draw. So this is a scenario here, but I think Brazil will manage to progress quite well. Speaking of Group D, there's the USA, Paraguay, and Australia here, and I think the USA should not only advance from this group but also top the group."

Mauricio Pochettino would be very upset if the USA even draws a game. Also, speaking of Group E, I think Germany should be quite happy. I know Ecuador is a very good team, and if we talk about their South American qualifications, Ecuador came second after Argentina. But I think Germany will be quite happy. Speaking of Congo or Ivory Coast, of course, Ivory Coast and Ecuador are challenging teams, but things could have been much worse for Germany, but the good thing is it happened with the Netherlands. Ronald Koeman is very lucky with the group he got; the Netherlands should not only qualify but also win. Speaking of Group G, Belgium, Egypt, Iran, and New Zealand, I think the support that the Netherlands received is the same support Belgium received. And in Group H, you'll see Lamine padding stats."

Spain will open up Uruguay with breaking moves, and I think there will be stat padding here and Spain will win by a large margin. Speaking of Group I, this is an amazing game, Mbapp\u00e9 versus Erling Haaland, Mbapp\u00e9 versus Erling Haaland, that is crazy, and if the winner of playoff two is Poland, then Lewandowski could also come in. So we could see some of the greatest and best strikers facing off against each other. And personally, I am very excited. France versus Norway, France versus Senegal, you know these will also be quite exciting games. Speaking of J..."

Again, when I'm giving this prediction here, don't consider it a sure-shot confirmation. It's the World Cup, it's the moment, it's the FIFA World Cup. Brother, it's that day, it's that match, anything can happen, but if we talk on paper here, Argentina is going to come out from this group with very high flying numbers and if we talk about the key of the group, meaning to look closely, then Portugal is the winner of Playoff One. I think the teams here in Call of Duty, meaning the gathering, I think Uzbekistan and Colombia, I think Uzbekistan could be a surprise package but not to the extent of doing something to Portugal. Again, now if you bring up Georgia here, then what can I say, but a team like Colombia, it's like James Rodriguez versus Cristiano Ronaldo, but I think if Portugal has any chances, any chances at all, then brother, they will have to win a group."

But alongside this, let's talk about Group L, so there is England, Croatia, Ghana, and Panama. I think England has been a bit trapped here. But I feel that the way England is playing under 'Took Kill', I think Croatia is aging. I know Croatia is the joint killer team. You can expect from Ghana. Panama could be a surprising package. I don't know, to be very honest. So I think not only will England qualify from this group but will also emerge as the group winner. And along with this, we now talk about the major and the biggest of them all. If Portugal and Argentina win their respective groups here, then they will clash in the quarter-finals. And as for Portugal, I tell you"

So this is it, brother, for Portugal, I feel God has said that if Ronaldo has to complete his story, then this is the way it will have to be done. The hardest way has been told here and the hard way here for Portugal starts from knockouts. But do you understand? Do you understand it is the biggest game? I'm saying the biggest game of the 21st century. I am sorry to say if I am hurting someone here or if I am offending anyone here. But I think this quarter-final is bigger than every"

You understand on one side Messi fans, on the other Ronaldo fans, one side Argentina Portugal and World Cup quarter-final. But again brother, this time we have Mbappe versus Haaland. I think this World Cup draw was very balanced, very well done. I know there's a lot of negativity regarding this World Cup. But just focusing on the football. I think there are a lot of things here you can focus on. Again, talking about England, they also have chances. Talk about Brazil, they've got a great opportunity.

Not any big team, but you can expect that the smaller teams, the weaker teams or the ones without expectations will upset the big teams because we all are thinking that if Portugal wins their group or Argentina wins theirs, the atmosphere will become very wavy and there will be excitement.

They wanted box office games to be preserved for the knockouts, and they possibly gave the biggest game of the century in the quarter-final. Now, I only have one desire, which I expect in the coming days, that Messi quickly confirms that he is playing for Argentina in the World Cup. I don't know, I don't feel why he is in doubt here.
